# Demo tiles placeholder

This folder reserves the `/tiles/demo/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` path used by the offline basemap. Real raster tiles are not bundled in the repository to avoid committing binaries. The offline basemap uses an in-memory placeholder tile so the map renders without external network access. If you have lightweight PNG tiles for Tallinn/Estonia at zoom levels 7–10, place them here following the `{z}/{x}/{y}.png` schema.
