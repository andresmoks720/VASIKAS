The application primarily utilizes R-Tree spatial indexing to handle complex geospatial calculations and real-time tracking efficiently.
Primary Spatial Index: R-Tree
The sources indicate a robust implementation of a Sort-Tile-Recursive (STR) tree, a specific type of query-only R-tree. This index is designed to manage spatial data by grouping objects into a hierarchical structure of bounding boxes, which allows the system to perform high-speed spatial queries without checking every individual polygon in the database.
Key Uses of Spatial Indexing
The application applies these indexes in several critical areas:
• Geofencing and Intrusion Detection: The app uses the index to perform point-in-polygon checks. This allows the "intrusion tracker" to immediately determine if a drone’s real-time coordinates intersect with restricted airspace or user-defined geofences.
• Offloading Computation: Spatial math is frequently handled by a Web Worker (namedLocationWorker.js) to prevent the user interface from lagging. This worker utilizes the spatial index to process border data and UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) zone information in the background.
• Geometric Processing: The index is used during intersection processing and "HotPixel" snapping. This ensures that when the app is calculating overlaps between different flight paths or airspace zones, it only processes objects that are geographically near one another.
• Historical Data Retrieval: For analyzing flight patterns, the system mentions intelligent indexing to enable fast retrieval of historical NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) and flight data based on geographic and temporal queries.
